This file contains details about the project.

1. The device used to debug this app was the OnePlus 7 Pro (6.67 inches).

2. To match the screen size of my phone I used the Pixel 3 XL (6.3 inches) option while editing the XML files.

3. The first_try variable in the forgot password page always gets a false value by the JSON file sent by the API, even if it is the first time we are asking for the OTP for that particular account. It is a bug from the API end.

4. Two databases were used. One for the favorites page and one to pass the cart items from the restaurant menu to the cart Activity.

5. Shared preferences were used for two things.
i) to store all the details of the user as and when they log in or register.
ii) along with the intent, I sent a boolean variable to notify the main activity that it must automatically open the favorites page (this was done to reflect the users preferences immediately).
